# CLI Code

> **Interact with your codebase using a conversational AI agent**

CLI Code is a powerful command-line interface that bridges your development workflow with AI-powered assistance. Chat with your codebase, execute commands, and get contextual help directly from your terminal.

## üöÄ Plan Mode System

**What makes CLI Code different from other AI coding tools?**

CLI Code introduces a unique **Plan Mode** system that dramatically reduces AI costs while maintaining exceptional performance - something no other tool offers.

### Two Modes, Maximum Efficiency

#### üî• **Lite Mode** (Recommended)
- **Cost Savings**: Up to **80% cheaper** than traditional AI coding tools
- **Smart Context Management**: Only sends relevant code context, not entire files
- **Selective Add-ons**: Choose only what you need
  - `memory` - Conversation history and learning
  - `github` - Repository integration and PR analysis  
  - `advanced-context` - Enhanced code understanding
- **Perfect for**: Daily coding, debugging, code reviews

#### ‚ö° **Full Mode** 
- **Complete Access**: All features enabled
- **Maximum Context**: Full file contents and comprehensive analysis
- **Enterprise Ready**: For complex codebases and team collaboration
- **Best for**: Large refactoring, architecture decisions, complex debugging



**Switch between modes instantly** with `/mode` command based on your current task complexity.
